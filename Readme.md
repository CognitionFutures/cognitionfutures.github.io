### **Jesse Parent, B.S.
Assistant Scientist, Lab Manager**
Orthogonal Research & Education Lab

Jesse Parent received his B.S. from the College of Engineering & Applied Sciences & CEHC at the University at Albany, SUNY. Jesse's current research involves computational models of developmental cognition. He is preparing for graduate study exploring natural and artificial intelligence; particularly cognition, learning, information processing, and the structures which support decision making and comprehension. Occasionally, he writes about the ethics surrounding such topics and related impacts on society. He is involved in science communication outreach & mentorship, journal clubs, and leading study groups in computational neuroscience and cognitive sciences.

### A Survey of Computational Models of Cognition

**Jesse Parent**
[In Preparation]

A tour of the existing landscape of modeling cognition, with a novel taxonomy and programming appendices & jupyter notebooks. This paper identifies existing themes and trajectories in computational models for cognition and suggests areas that are ripe for future researchers to explore. Associated educational materials are also in development.

Originally a NMA Group Project, now ongoing at OREL: a comparison of models of feedback at different levels of complexity, using the IBL data set. "What is the relationship between feedback and performance given representational models at different levels of complexity? That is, starting from a zero representational model, what is the tradeoff agents make in terms of performance for a certain level of feedback complexity? Some complex behaviors may require representation within an agent's mind. Can we compare models of different amounts of representation?"

We present a framework for meta-brain models, or hybrid models that capture multiple aspects of developmental neuro- biology and behavior. A developmentally-inspired embodied learning agent architecture is combined with a contextually- explicit representational layer to form a complex artificial nervous system. The architectural description is summarized in terms of morphological differentiation, context-handling, and generalized architectural features. In conclusion, we propose potential functional milestones that help further explicate the usefulness of our approach.

### Braitenberg Vehicles as Developmental Neurosimulation

[Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07689) | GitHub

Our purpose is to model the development of an artificial organism that exhibits complex behaviors. We will introduce our approach, which is to use Braitenberg Vehicles (BVs) to model the development of an artificial nervous system. The resulting developmental BVs will generate behaviors that range from stimulus responses to group behavior that resembles collective motion. Next, we will situate this work in the domain of artificial brain networks. Then we will focus on broader themes such as embodied cognition, feedback, and emergence. Our perspective will then be exemplified by three software instantiations that demonstrate how a BV-genetic algorithm hybrid model, multisensory Hebbian learning model, and multi-agent approaches can be used to approach BV development.
