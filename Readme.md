# COGNITION FUTURES
In Association with [Orthogonal Research and Education Laboratory](http://orthogonal-research.weebly.com/)

**Cognition Futures** is a new research team within OREL. We focus on computational models of cognition, with  particular emphasis on developmental and embodied approaches to understanding behavior, evolution, allostasis of intelligent agents and systems. We also study the philosophy and history underpinning trajectories of investigation in to cognition, aiming to map out areas ripe for future study while minding what has influenced historical lines of inquiries.
